    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">
        <h2>Question 3: Let us examine the rationality of various vacuum-cleaner agent functions.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3">
        <p>A rational agent selects actions that maximize its expected performance measure. For the vacuum-cleaner agent:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Simple Vacuum-Cleaner Rationality:</strong></li>
                - Perceives location and dirt status (e.g., [A, Dirty]).<br/>
                - Actions available: Left, Right, Suck, NoOp.<br/>
                - Rational if it chooses Suck when there's dirt and moves to explore other squares when clean.
            
            <li><strong>Movement Costs One Point:</strong></li>
                - Maintains internal state (model-based reflex agent).<br/>
                - Balances movement cost against cleaning benefit.<br/>
                - Performance measure accounts for cleanliness and movement costs.
            
            <li><strong>Dynamic Environments:</strong></li>
                - Learning becomes crucial.<br/>
                - The agent should learn:
                    * Dirt accumulation patterns.
                    * Environment geography.
                    * Optimal cleaning strategies.
        </ol>

     <!-- Question 4 -->
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">
        <h2>Question 4: Define the following terms...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer4">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Agent:</strong> An entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it through actuators.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Function:</strong> Maps percept sequences to actions (`f: P* → A`).</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Program:</strong> The concrete implementation of the agent function that runs on physical architecture.</li>
            <li><strong>Rationality:</strong> A rational agent selects actions maximizing expected performance based on percepts and knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> The ability to operate independently without human intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflex Agent:</strong> Uses simple condition-action rules without internal state or memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Model-Based Agent:</strong> Maintains internal state to track aspects of the environment using a transition model.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal-Based Agent:</strong> Plans actions to achieve explicit goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility-Based Agent:</strong> Assigns utility values to states and maximizes expected utility.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning Agent:</strong> Improves performance over time through learning mechanisms (critic, learning element, problem generator).</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">
        <h2>Question 5: Is a thermostat an instance of a simple reflex agent, a model-based reflex agent, or a goal-based agent?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer5">
        <p>The thermostat is an instance of a <strong>simple reflex agent</strong>, as it operates on fixed condition-action rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rules:</strong></li>
                - `IF (temperature ≤ setting - 3) THEN turn_on_furnace`.<br/>
                - `IF (temperature ≥ setting + 3) THEN turn_off_furnace`.
            
            <li><strong>Characteristics of Simple Reflex Agents:</strong></li>
                - No internal state maintenance required.<br/>
                - Direct mapping from current percept to action.
            
            <li><strong>Contrasts with Other Agents:</strong></li>
                - Unlike model-based agents: No state tracking or prediction.<br/>
                - Unlike goal-based agents: No reasoning about future states.<br/>
                - Unlike utility-based agents: No evaluation of outcomes.
        </ol>

        <h2>Question 6: Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer6">
        <p><strong>Using intelligent agent concepts:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initial Problem Formulation:</strong></li>
                - State space includes robot's location `(x,y)`, orientation (North/East/South/West), actions (Turn/Move Forward), and percepts (Wall detection).<br/>
                - Performance measure: Steps to exit.
            
            <li><strong>Intersection-Based Reformulation:</strong></li>
                - Reduced state space by tracking only intersection points and orientation.
            
            <li><strong>Direction-Based Reformulation:</strong></li>
                - Further reduced state space by tracking only intersection points without orientation.
            
            <li><strong>Real-World Simplifications:</strong></li>
                Assumptions based on environment properties include fully observable, deterministic movements, discrete space, static environment, and no physical constraints like momentum or friction.
